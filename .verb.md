## Getting started

If you want to see how breakdance works, the CLI is the fastest way to get started. 

### Installing the CLI

Install the breakdance CLI with [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/):

```sh
$ npm install  --global breakdance-cli
```

This adds the `bd` command to your system path, allowing you to run the breakdance CLI from any directory. 

```sh
$ bd
# also aliased as "breakdance" in case of conflicts
$ breakdance
```

See the [breakdance documentation](http://breakdance.io/docs.html#getting-started) for more information about usage and options.
